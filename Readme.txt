My Professional Portfolio Website
This is a single-page, fully responsive portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information. It is built using modern web standards and styled with a professional, dark theme.
✨ Features
Responsive Design: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewing using Tailwind CSS.
Dark Theme: A sleek, modern aesthetic with high contrast for readability.
Smooth Navigation: Utilizes smooth scrolling for an enhanced user experience between sections.
Key Sections: Includes Hero/Introduction, Skills, Featured Projects, and a Contact Form.
Single-File Deployment: All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are contained within one file (index.html) for easy hosting and sharing.
🛠️ Technology Stack
This project leverages the following technologies:
HTML5: Provides the core structure and semantic content.
JavaScript (Vanilla JS): Handles interactive elements like the mobile menu toggle and form submission simulation.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used via CDN for rapid, consistent, and responsive styling.
🚀 Setup and Usage
Because this is a single, self-contained HTML file, running the application is extremely simple:
Save the file: Ensure the provided code is saved as index.html.
Open in Browser: Simply double-click the index.html file in your file explorer. It will open directly in your preferred web browser.
Deployment: To host it online, upload the index.html file to any static web hosting service (like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).
📧 Customization
To make this template your own, you will need to edit the following parts in the index.html file:
Content: Update the text in the Hero section (name, title, bio), Skills list, and Projects details.
Links: Replace all javascript:void(0) placeholders with your actual social media, project, and CV download links.
Contact Form: In a real production environment, you must replace the simulated form submission logic in the <script> block with an actual service endpoint (like Formspree, Firebase, or a custom backend) to process messages.
